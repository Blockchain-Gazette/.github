# Blockchain Gazette  

What if blockchain news, information and education isn’t controlled by **"centralized media"** but instead thrives in an **open and permissionless ecosystem**?  

This is the future **Blockchain Gazette** is thriving for and building.

This project began as an **open-source media experiment**, empowering blockchain projects (such as the [DFINITY Foundation](https://x.com/Blockgazette/status/1690442696697999360), and the [Sia Foundation](https://x.com/Blockgazette/status/1765457090762461689?t=yF9pGy-Lt-S5rf2ZZvr44w&s=19)) with well-researched blockchain-based educational content in a variety of digital formats.

Now, we intend to take the next leap: soon, we will launch a **Decentralized Media Protocol**—a permissionless framework where contributors, curators, and consumers interact seamlessly to scale blockchain education!0x14e80618B4732DfeE4806cA897cE2dce08472eCe
